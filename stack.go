//Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
//Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
//threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetO-fStacks should be
//composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
//SetOfStacks. push() and SetOfStacks. pop() should behave identically to a single stack
//(that is, pop () should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
//FOLLOW UP
//Implement a function popAt ( int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.

//Queue via Stacks: Implement a MyQueue class which implements a queue using two stacks.



//Sort Stack: Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use
//an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure
//(such as an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, and is Empty.


//Animal Shelter: An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly"first in, first
//out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter,
//or they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of
//that type). They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create the data structures to
//maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog,
//and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in Linked list data structure.
